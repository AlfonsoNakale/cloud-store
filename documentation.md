# Documentation

This modular structure provides several benefits:

- Better organization and separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability
- Better reusability
- Easier testing
- Better scalability

Each module has a specific responsibility:

- constants.js: Stores all configuration values
- utils.js: Contains utility functions
- uiManager.js: Handles all UI-related operations
- fileManager.js: Manages file operations and business logic
- main.js: Entry point that initializes the application
